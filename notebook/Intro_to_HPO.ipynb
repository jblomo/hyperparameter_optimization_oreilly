Modelers often spend significant time on tasks like tracking runs, creating visualizations, and troubleshooting hyperparameter optimization jobs, all of which could be supported or automated with software.*\n\n*Join expert Jim Blomo to learn best practices for tracking, training, and tuning models and using the information from these processes to make the best decisions around the model development process. You’ll focus specifically on hyperparameter optimization (HPO): selecting the best method, executing tuning jobs, and analyzing the results of these jobs to select the best model for production. Along the way, you’ll see firsthand just how useful HPO is through an anomaly detection problem (based on a Kaggle financial dataset) that uses an XGBoost classification model. You’ll then use SigOpt to perform your own tuning jobs and cover open source alternatives and how to implement them* - [O'Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/live-training/courses/introduction-to-hyperparameter-optimization/0636920470830/#instructors)\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Instructor: Jim Blomo\n\n*Jim Blomo is an executive engineering leader at SigOpt.

Its secondary objective is to dive deeper into hyperparameter tuning, and, through the process, help attendees develop some intuition around the practical aspects of automated model optimization.\n\n> First, we will spend time discussing the best ways to track runs as you go through the modeling process. Second, we will discuss useful visualizations for analyzing model behavior, comparing architectures, and evaluating metrics. Finally, we will delve into methods for automated hyperparameter optimization with a focus on how tuning hyperparameters boosts model performance, provides model insights, and bolsters modeling workflows and team collaboration.\n\nWe will present an anomaly detection problem based on this [Kaggle financial dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ntnu-testimon/paysim1) using a [XGBoost classification model](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to show rather than tell how HPO can be useful. After presenting the use case and the dataset, we’ll dive into the optimization journey, presenting the model performance and workflow uplifts that a modeler can observe when following a structured optimization approach using SigOpt. The session will feature multiple interactive sections including code exercises and group discussions that will utilize Jupyter notebooks. Every attendee will get free access to [SigOpt](https://sigopt.com/) so they can perform their own tuning jobs as part of the tutorial. We will also cover open source alternatives to SigOpt and train attendees on how to integrate them if they need a replacement for SigOpt.\n\n\n## 🚦 **TO DO [Recommended but optional] - Sign up for a free SigOpt account in order to follow along during the tutorial - [SIGN UP FOR SIGOPT](https://modeling.sigopt.com/oreilly-offer).**\n\n*- After signing up for the SigOpt account you will recieve an email with instructions on how to activate your personal SigOpt account.*\n\n___"},{"metadata":{"id":"zWQDFfjR1n5F"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Session Agenda\n\nThis session is divided in three sections;\n\n* [__Data Import and preprocessing__](#Data-Import-and-Preprocessing)\n    * Modeling Environment\n    * Importing Libraries\n    * Importing the Dataset\n    * Defining our Feature and Label Sets\n    * Objective Metric Selection\n    * Splitting the dataset\n* [__Experiment Tracking__](#Experiment-Tracking)\n    * Experiment Tracking with SigOpt\n        * Training Runs\n        * Experiments\n    * Setting Up SigOpt\n    * Setting our baseline\n* [__Hyperparameter Optimization__](#Hyperparameter-Optimization)\n    * Define your Parameter Space\n    * Configure your Experiment\n    * Instrument your model and run your Experiment\n    * Multimetric Experimentation\n* [__Learn more at your own time__](#Learn-more-at-your-own-time)\n    * EfficientBERT\n    * Advanced features\n    * Documentation\n\nThere will be a 5 min break between the Experiment Tracking and Hyperparameter Optimization sections.

Although BERT has accelerated many modeling efforts, its size is limiting. In this talk, we will explore how to reduce the size of BERT while retaining its capacity in the context of English Question Answering tasks. We'll show how scalable hyperparameter optimization can help you tackle difficult modeling problems, draw insights, and make informed decisions.\n\n> Our approach encompasses fine-tuning, distillation, architecture search, and hyperparameter optimization at scale. First, we fine-tune BERT on SQUAD 2.0 (our teacher model) and use distillation to compress fine-tuned BERT to a smaller model (our student model). Then, combining SigOpt and Ray, we use multimetric Bayesian optimization at scale to find the optimal architecture for the student model. Finally, we explore the trade-offs of our hyperparameter decisions to draw insights for our student model's architecture. \n\n___\n\n## Advanced features\n\n🚦 **TO DO [At your own time] - [At your own time] Learn about SigOpt's [advanced features](https://app.sigopt.com/docs/overview/multimetric) for optimization**\n\n> The SigOp optimization engine goes beyond traditional hyperparameter tuning packages and methods with numerous advanced features that empower modelers to accelerate model development and solve new optimization problems.\n\n___\n\n\n## Documentation\n\n🚦 **TO DO [At your own time] - [At your own time] Learn about SigOpt by looking through the [documentation](https://app.sigopt.com/docs)**\n\n___"}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"[O'Reilly] Intro_to_HPO_F9.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.7.8","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
